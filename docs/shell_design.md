# Shell Design Document

## Introduction
This document describes the design of a basic shell implemented in C and C++. The shell will support basic commands and functionality.

## Shell Structure

### Main Loop
The shell operates using a simple loop: it displays a prompt, reads a line of input from the user, parses the line into a command and its arguments, executes the command, and then repeats.

### Command Parsing
The shell parses the input line by splitting it into words, using whitespace as the delimiter. The first word is the command, and the remaining words are the arguments.

### Command Execution
The shell executes the command by creating a new process using the `fork()` system call, and then using the `exec()` system call to replace the new process's image with the command's executable.

## Shell Features

### Built-in Commands
The shell will support a number of built-in commands, such as `cd` for changing the current directory and `exit` for terminating the shell.

### Command History
The shell will maintain a history of previously executed commands, allowing the user to easily repeat commands.

### Command Completion
The shell will provide command completion, suggesting possible completions when the user presses the Tab key.

### Error Handling
The shell will handle errors gracefully, displaying informative error messages and continuing to operate.

## Outcome
This document provides a high-level design for a basic shell. The next step is to implement this design in C and C++, testing each feature thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
